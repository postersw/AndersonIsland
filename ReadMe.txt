Created 1/31 by Phonegap developer:
	/.cordova
	/hooks
	/platforms
	/plugins
	/www  this contains all my source
Created 2/5 by Visual Studio - which is not needed by phonegap build:
	/.vs
	/bin
	/bld
	AndersonIsland.jsproj
	AndersonIsland.jsproj.user
	AndersonIsland.sln
	taco.json


I probably should move all this to a gethub account
