    <h2>Installing and Using the App. </h2>
        You can use the Anderson Island Assistant as a web-based app, or as a phone-app installed on your Android phone (Samsung, Motorola, etc.) or iPhone.
        Windows Phone users must use it as a web-based app. All versions of the app have the same functionality.  
        The advantage of the phone version is that it loads faster, 
        and works better when there is limited network connectivity (true on many places on Anderson Island).
        <p>Web-based.<br /><a href="www.anderson-island.org">Click here to run on any web browser on your phone, tablet, or computer.</a>
            To create a shortcut on your desktop, click on the menu bar at the top right or left of your browser screen, and then select
            "Add to Home Screen".
            <p>Android Phone Users:<br />
                You can install the app from the Google Play Store (recommended) or from this web site.
                <br /><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.anderson_island.andersonislandassistant">From Google Play.</a> Click on the Google Play icon on your phone, then enter 'andersonislandassistant' into 
                the search bar, and click on Search or Find.  The Anderson Island Assistant will appear. Click on Install. The app will install
                and place an icon on your desktop.
                <br /><a href="http://www.anderson-island.org/AIA.apk">From this web site</a>. To install from our web site, you must first
            give your phone permission to do this: select Settings -> Security, scroll down to 'Unknown Sources', and turn on 'Allow installation of apps from unknown sources'.
                Then click on the link above.
            </p>
            <p>iPhone Users<br />This app is under review by the Apple App Store. Instructions will be posted here on how to install it.
