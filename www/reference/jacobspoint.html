    <strong>FACILITIES</strong>: <br />
    The park has 82 beautiful acres of beach, woods, and wetlands.  
    <ul>
    <li>The main trail is 1.1 miles long with a total distance of about 2.5 miles round trip. </li>
    <li>The overlooks with spit rail fencing and picnic tables have views of Vega Bay, Oro Bay, South Puget Sound and Mt. Rainer.  </li>
    <li>Interpretive signs help you appreciate what nature has to offer and acknowledges the Jacobs Family.  </li>
    <li>You will pass over a raised 100-foot long walkway across a wetland and eventually hikers encounter stair access to the beach.  
        The beach at the bottom of the stairs is an excellent place for hand powered watercraft to take a break. </li>
     <li>The trail extends about 1/4 past the stairs to the beach.  Just past the stairs is a composting toilet.  Currently the trail ends at an overlook with a gorgeous view of Mt. Rainer - on a clear day.  Eventually the trail may extend. 
     Take the time to stop at the foot bridge and overlooks to observe and listen to nature's sounds.</li>
    <li>There is a sea cave near stairs down to the beach. </li>
     <li>The shoreline is a salmon nursery area.  </li>
    <li>At least one family of coyotes has been frequently near the raised walkway and frogs sounds are deafening at times. </li> 
    </ul>
    <p>
    The waters around Jacobs Point are part of the Nisqually Reach Aquatic Reserve, 
    and park shorelines provide food and shelter for juvenile salmon migrating out from the Nisqually Delta. 
     The park has several distinct habitats including second-growth forest, two wetlands, clay bluffs, 
    a seasonal creek with a small estuary, mudflats, and a gravelly beach.
      The forest has been logged and grazed, but is on its way back to its natural state.

    <strong>HISTORY</strong>:    <br />
      Jacobs Point Park was purchased in 2011 from Young Life with funds from the Pierce County Conservation Futures Fund and the 
    Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office’s Aquatic Lands Enhancement Account. 
     The Conservation group Forterra guided the Park District through the grant and purchase processes. <br />
      Historically, the property was a pioneer farm dating from 1915, and connected with a former brick yard which is located on adjoining property the Jacobs family still owns.
    A lone mossy chimney remains from the original Jacobs homestead.
