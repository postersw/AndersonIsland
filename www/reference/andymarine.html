    <strong>HISTORY</strong>:    <br />
    The core of the park was the gift of Andrew Anderson (1895-1975), a true visionary concerned with the preservation of the way of life we cherish on our island.
    Twentyone acres were added on the north end of this park in 2008 courtesy of a Conservation Futures grant with the support of the Cascade Land Conservancy.
