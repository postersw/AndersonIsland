    <h1>Anderson Island Association and Island Sounder Newsletter</h1>
    <h2>Anderson Island Association</h2>
    <p>The Anderson Island Association ("AIA") was formed in 1981 with an original
        charter to address law enforcement and safety issues as an interface with 
        Pierce County  The AIA has since evolved into a communication entity and sponsor of other island activities, such as the AIGS bulletin board,
        summer ice cream social, island clean-up, and the Christmas Star Lighting.
    </p>
    <p>The AIA publishes the Island Sounder, a monthly newsletter that includes upcoming island events, 
        news, and advertisements for companies doing business on Anderson Island.</p>
    <h2>Island Sounder</h2>
    <p>The Island Sounder is prepared and distributed by the Anderson Island Association as a communication 
    vehicle for Anderson Island.  We welcome and encourage reports from the various island organizations and 
        comments on a wide range of subjects related to the island. </p>
