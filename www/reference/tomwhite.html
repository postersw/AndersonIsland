    <strong>FACILITIES</strong>: <br />
    Five acres.  A short trail with steps down from the trailhead leads to a lovely foot bridge across Schoolhouse Creek,
     where Tom worked with the Island school children to respore the historic fish runs in the creek.  
    The trail then traverses the hillside.  Up stream from the bridge is where thousands of fertilized Chum salmon eggs were incubated, hatched and released as fry by the Parks District.  It is hope that in about 4 years at least some of these fish will return. 
     The District intends to continue this process until we are assured that the runs will be self sustaining.

    <strong>LOCATION</strong>: <br />
    Located on Eckenstam-Johnson Road across from the "Old School House".
