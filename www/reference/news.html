    <tr><td><strong>7/20/18 FERRY NOTIFICATIONS: </strong><br/>Beginning 9/1/18, versions of this app older than version 1.19
        will no longer receive ferry notifications. If your app is not at version 1.19 or newer, please update it by going to the
        Apple App Store for iPhones, or the Google Play Store for Android phones, and searching for Anderson Island Assistant.  
        The App Version can be found at the bottom of the main screen (the first screen) for the App.  (With version 1.19 in June 2018
        we changed the service provider that send notifications from 'Pushbots' to 'OneSignal' - the old 'Pushbots' service will be turned off on 9/1/18.)
