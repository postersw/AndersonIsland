    <tr><td><strong>3/17/20 Corona Virus Info for AI</strong><br/>Beginning on 3/17, a Corona Virus resource page for Anderson Island residents has been 
        created and posted.  The work is produced by an ad-hoc committee known as the Anderson Island Corona Virus Preparedness Committee, led by 
        Kathy Neusbaum. It consists of representatives from all major island organizations.  Contact Kathy Neusbaum for more information.

     <tr><td><strong>3/14/20 Ferry Location Link</strong><br/>Sometime in February, the Ferry Location tracker maintained by Pierce County Ferry was changed, 
         and this change meant that it no longer worked reliably when started from the Anderson Island Assistant.  <br/>
         On 3/14/20, a new 'link' was created
         which reliably opens the Ferry Location tracker. This link is accessed by clicking on Island Information Links, and then on Ferry Location. <br/>
         On 3/16/20 a new version of the Anderson Island Assistant was released for Android phones. This version will reliably open the Ferry Location
         tracker from the "Ferry Location" button on row two of the app.   A new version of iPhones is in the works and will be released soon.  
         If you have an Android phone, make sure that your are running version 1.25 (see the bottom of the front page of the app).
