       <b>ABOUT US </b><br/>
    The Anderson Island Volunteer Island Patrol (VIP) is an all volunteer organization. While
the VIP is not a law enforcement agency, the Patrol addresses safety and security
issues and works with the Pierce County Sheriff staff. The VIP is funded through the
Pierce County Council and donations from Anderson Island organizations.

    <b>HOUSE CHECK</b> <br/>
To request a house check by the VIP, we ask that an “Affidavit of Access Form” be filled
out, signed, and returned to us. <a href="affidavitofaccess.pdf">Click here to access this form.</a> <p>Please
call our Response Number (253-970-5403) for instructions on sending the form to the
VIP to be added to the house check list.There is no charge for house checks, but
donations are gratefully accepted by the VIP. House checks are done for island home
owners who leave their property for an extended amount of time.
<p>
   <b>MEMBERSHIP</b><br/>
To apply for membership to the VIP, an interview with board members, a background
check and a driving record review is done. Each member receives a uniform shirt, hat,
vest and jacket.
New members work with a VIP trainer who is experienced in patrols, house checks
and record keeping.
